DateTime is a structure in the system namespace. To create a dateTime object, use the new operator which can take multiple overloads.
We can specify year month and day or  to be more specific  we can go up to hour minute and second. 
It has a bunch of different constructors. 'Now'and 'Today' are  static properties of DateTime structure. With DateTime object components like year, month, day ,minute and hour can be accessed easily.

One important thing to remember about DateTime object is that they are immutable which means once we create them we cannot change them.
To modify them there are a bunch of methods and they all start with ADD.
